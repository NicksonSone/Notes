Since human beings make noise, use gestures, employ combinations of objects and actions to convey 
meaning, there is a place for a discipline to analyze this kind of activity and make explicit the 
systems of convention on which it rests.
Semioitcs is based on the assumption that insofar as human actions or prodcutions convey meaning,
insofar as they function as signs, there must be an underlying system of conventions and distinctions
which make this meaning possible. Where there are signs there is system. This is what various 
signifying activities have in common, and if one is determined to find their essential nature one must 
not treat them in isolation but as examples of semiotic systems.
Various topologies of signs have been proposed, but three fundamental classes of signs seem to stand
out as requiring different approaches: the icon, the index and the sign proper(sometimes misleadingly
called 'symbol'). All signs consist of a signifier and a signified, a form and an associative meaning;
but the relations between signifier and signified are different for each of these three types of sign.
An icon involves actual resemblance between signifier and signified. In an index, the relation between
signifier and signified is causal. In the sign proper, the relation between signifier and signified 
is arbitary and conventional.
