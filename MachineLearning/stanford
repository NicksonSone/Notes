Lecture 1
four major topics: supervised learning, learning theory, unsupervised learning and reinforcement 
learning.

Applications
1. Supervised learning: predict house price or something
2. Learning theory: why learning algorithms work, how well they perform and how much data is needed
to train the model
3. Unsupervised learning: usually the first step of unsupervised learning is clustering. Can be applied
to fields like image processing(even computer vision), audio processing(voice recognition), turmor 
classification
4. Reinforcement learning: reward function is used. Every time a good decision is made, there is a 
reward. Otherwise, bad effects accumulates. It is only when the consequence of bad decisions is 
worse enough that you can see obvious outcome. Like dog traning, how maximize good dog reward 
and minimze bad dog punishment.


Lecture 2
Linear Regression: supervised learning algorithm

basic learning process
training set (as input)--> learning algorithm --> hypothesis (as output)

To Design a Learning algorithm:
1.design hypothesis representation, like linear function, square function etc

Gradient Descent
Normal Equations
